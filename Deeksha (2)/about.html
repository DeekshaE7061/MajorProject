  <h1 id="demo" style="color:blue"><b>Health And Nutrition</b></h1>
  <p>Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite for healthy life. A proper diet is essential from very early
     age of life for growth, development and active life. Nutrition is the science that deals with all the various factors 
     of which food is composed and the way in which proper nourishment is brought about.
    The average nutritional requirements of groups of people are fixed and depend on such measurable characteristics such 
    as age, sex, height, weight, degree of activity and rate of growth. In this section following are covered in detai
   </p> 
    <h2 style="color:blue"> Nutrition  importantance</h2>
    <p>Proteins are made from amino acids and they are vital for living beings to carry out a wide range of functions essential for life.
         Almost half of the protein in our body is in the form of muscles. The quality of protein depends upon the content of essential amino acid in the food.
    </p><br>
<p>Vitamins are the most commonly known micronutrients, which are essential organic compounds that the body needs to function but which it can’t create on its own.
     There are thirteen different vitamins people need including A, D, E, K, eight different B vitamins, and C.<br>
    Other micronutrients are the minerals, which we don’t need in as large a quantity as the other nutrients listed, but there is a wide range of minerals that we should be getting, 
    which can make it difficult to get them all.
    The minerals we need include magnesium, iron, zinc, potassium, calcium, chloride, sodium, manganese, copper, and several more. There are 16 different minerals that we need to thrive.
    </p>
<h2 style="color:darkorchid"> Nutritional Imbalance</h2>
<p>A nutritional imbalance happens when you are not getting the right amounts of all of the nutrients you need. You can have too much of something, but it is generally more serious to have too little of a nutrient.

    To help maintain your body and keep it strong you need to have a balanced diet as well as a nutritional one.
    
    Different nutrients have very different jobs in the body and show up as different kinds of deficiency when they are lacking.
    
    If you are missing all of the nutrients in general, such as being completely deprived of food and water then you can become malnourished.
    
    You can become deficient in certain nutrients for a number of reasons:
    <ul>
    
   <li> Not consuming enough of them</li>
   <li> Your body has difficulty processing one or more
    Disease</li>
   <li> Medications can deplete them
    Stress</li>
    <li>Your digestive system isn’t working properly</li>
    <li> have an allergy or sensitivity to certain nutrients</li></ul>
    Nutritional imbalances or deficiencies are usually very easily tested for, and in most cases can also be easily remedied.
   </p>
   <h2 style="color: darkblue;">Easy ways to improve Nutrition</h2>
   <P>The best way to get the nutrition you need is through your diet. The body usually processes food better than supplements, so this is the most effective and efficient way to get what you need.<br>
    But if diet can’t do it because you can’t get the food you need or your body won’t tolerate it, then supplements are available to, well, supplement your diet and nutrition needs
    </P>
    <h2 style="color: darkmagenta;">Eat a Regular and balanced and Nutritious diet</h2>
    <p>People need to consume around 2000 calories a day, usually across 3 to 6 meals. Eating a healthy diet means not going over that amount too often, trying not to skip meals, because we tend to overcompensate for it later, and to get our daily calorie allowance from the right foods.<br>

        Around half of what we eat should be fruit and vegetables in a wide range of colours – the broader the rainbow the better. Then around a quarter of our intake should come from proteins like meat, chicken, fish, legumes, dairy and nuts, and around a quarter from carbohydrates like wholegrains and starchy vegetables.<br>
        
        We should eat very little fat or sugar that has been added to food and instead get both our fats and energy intake from the sources we listed above. Healthy fats come from proteins and things like avocados and olive oil, while healthy sugars come from fruit and dairy.
        
        </p>
        <h1 id="css" style="color:royalblue ;">YOGA</h1>
        <p >If you’ve done your “downward dog” yoga pose today, you’re probably feeling more relaxed. Regardless of your level of yoga expertise, if you’re practicing regularly, you can feel better from head to toe.

            Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all ages. And, if you’re going through an illness, recovering from surgery or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part of your treatment and potentially hasten healing. 
            
            A yoga therapist can work with patients and put together individualized plans that work together with their medical and surgical therapies. That way, yoga can support the healing process and help the person experience symptoms with more centeredness and less distress.
            
            </p>
            <h2>1.Yoga improves strength,balance and flexibility.</h2>
            <p>Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.

                Try it: Tree Pose
                Balance on one foot, while holding the other foot to your calf or above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle. Try to focus on one spot in front of you, while you balance for one minute. 
                
                </p>
            <h2>2.Yoga helps with back pain relief.</h2>
            <p>Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.

                Try it: Cat-Cow Pose
                Get on all fours, placing your palms underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. First, inhale, as you let your stomach drop down toward the floor. Then, exhale, as you draw your navel toward your spine, arching your spine like a cat stretching.  
                </p>
                <h2>3.Yoga benifits heart health.</h2>
                <p>Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts. Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed through yoga.

                    Try it: Downward Dog Pose
                    Get on all fours, then tuck your toes under and bring your sitting bones up, so that you make a triangle shape. Keep a slight bend in your knees, while lengthening your spine and tailbone.
                    
                    </p>
                <h2>4.Yoga helps you manage stress.</h2>
                <p>According to the National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence shows that yoga supports stress management, mental health, mindfulness, healthy eating, weight loss and quality sleep.
                    Lie down with your limbs gently stretched out, away from the body, with your palms facing up. Try to clear your mind while breathing deeply. You can hold this pose for 5 to 15 minutes.
